# Web Search

Some models and systems on Groq have native support for access to real-time web content, allowing them to answer questions with up-to-date information beyond their knowledge cutoff. API responses automatically include citations with a complete list of all sources referenced from the search results.

  
Unlike [Browser Search](https://console.groq.com/docs/browser-search) which mimics human browsing behavior by navigating websites interactively, web search performs a single search and retrieves text snippets from webpages.

The use of this tool with a supported model or system in GroqCloud is not a HIPAA Covered Cloud Service under Groq's Business Associate Addendum at this time. This tool is also not available currently for use with regional / sovereign endpoints.

## [Supported Systems](#supported-systems)

Built-in web search is supported for the following systems:

| Model ID           | System                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| groq/compound      | [Compound](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound/systems/compound)           |
| groq/compound-mini | [Compound Mini](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound/systems/compound-mini) |

  
For a comparison between the `groq/compound` and `groq/compound-mini` systems and more information regarding additional capabilities, see the [Compound Systems](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound/systems#system-comparison) page.

## [Quick Start](#quick-start)

To use web search, change the `model` parameter to one of the supported models.

Python

```
from groq import Groq
import json

client = Groq()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="groq/compound",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What happened in AI last week? Provide a list of the most important model releases and updates."
        }
    ]
)

# Final output
print(response.choices[0].message.content)

# Reasoning + internal tool calls
print(response.choices[0].message.reasoning)

# Search results from the tool calls
if response.choices[0].message.executed_tools:
    print(response.choices[0].message.executed_tools[0].search_results)
```

```
import Groq from "groq-sdk";

const groq = new Groq();

const response = await groq.chat.completions.create({
  model: "groq/compound",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "What happened in AI last week? Provide a list of the most important model releases and updates."
    },
  ]
});

// Final output
console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);

// Reasoning + internal tool calls
console.log(response.choices[0].message.reasoning);

// Search results from the tool calls
console.log(response.choices[0].message.executed_tools?.[0].search_results);
```

```
curl "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${GROQ_API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What happened in AI last week? Provide a list of the most important model releases and updates."
          }
        ],
        "model": "groq/compound"
      }'
```

_And that's it!_

  
When the API is called, it will intelligently decide when to use web search to best answer the user's query. These tool calls are performed on the server side, so no additional setup is required on your part to use built-in tools.

### [Final Output](#final-output)

This is the final response from the model, containing the synthesized answer based on web search results. The model combines information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive response with automatic citations. Use this as the primary output for user-facing applications.

  
message.content

What happened in AI last week is that several significant model releases and updates took place. Based on the search results and information gathered, here is a list of the most important AI model releases and updates from last week:

### [Reasoning and Internal Tool Calls](#reasoning-and-internal-tool-calls)

This shows the model's internal reasoning process and the search queries it executed to gather information. You can inspect this to understand how the model approached the problem and what search terms it used. This is useful for debugging and understanding the model's decision-making process.

## [Search Settings](#search-settings)

Customize web search behavior by using the `search_settings` parameter. This parameter allows you to exclude specific domains from search results or restrict searches to only include specific domains. These parameters are supported for both `groq/compound` and `groq/compound-mini`.

| Parameter        | Type       | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| exclude\_domains | string\[\] | List of domains to exclude when performing web searches. Supports wildcards (e.g., "\*.com")                                    |
| include\_domains | string\[\] | Restrict web searches to only search within these specified domains. Supports wildcards (e.g., "\*.edu")                        |
| country          | string     | Boost search results from a specific country. This will prioritize content from the selected country in the web search results. |

### [Domain Filtering with Wildcards](#domain-filtering-with-wildcards)

Both `include_domains` and `exclude_domains` support wildcard patterns using the `*` character. This allows for flexible domain filtering:

* Use `*.com` to include/exclude all .com domains
* Use `*.edu` to include/exclude all educational institutions
* Use specific domains like `example.com` to include/exclude exact matches

You can combine both parameters to create precise search scopes. For example:

* Include only .com domains while excluding specific sites
* Restrict searches to specific country domains
* Filter out entire categories of websites

## [Pricing](#pricing)

Please see the [Pricing](https://groq.com/pricing) page for more information.

  
There are two types of web search: [basic search](#basic-search) and [advanced search](#advanced-search), and these are billed differently.

### [Basic Search](#basic-search)

A more basic, less comprehensive version of search that provides essential web search capabilities. Basic search is supported on Compound version `2025-07-23`. To use basic search, specify the version in your API request. See [Compound System Versioning](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound#system-versioning) for details on how to set your Compound version.

### [Advanced Search](#advanced-search)

The default search experience that provides more comprehensive and intelligent search results. Advanced search is automatically used with Compound versions newer than `2025-07-23` and offers enhanced capabilities for better information retrieval and synthesis.

## [Provider Information](#provider-information)

Web search functionality is powered by [Tavily](https://tavily.com/), a search API optimized for AI applications. Tavily provides real-time access to web content with intelligent ranking and citation capabilities specifically designed for language models.
